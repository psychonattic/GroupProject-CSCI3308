## Modular Monopoly (Mod-opoly)

## Description:
An open source, customizable Monopoly clone written in pygame

## Vision Statement:
To create an open source Monopoly game using pygame, with the ability to customize the board to the user's liking.

## Motivation: 
To make players smile while combining our love of modularity and board game.

## Risks: 
 * Limited experience with pygames framework
 * Cross-platform difficulties (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc.)
 * Schedule conflicts among group members
 * No prior experience working with the group members
 * Legal/copyright questions

## Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk:
 * We will each research Pygames to familiarize ourselves with it
 * We can perform development on the school computers, giving us equal development environments
 * We will only use open-source graphics or create our own to take away legal risk
 * We will meet regularly at predefined times to discuss the project, using online tools to schedule

## Project plan:

##RUN:
* Download the git project and extract it.
* In the terminal, navigate to the directory Mod-Opoly-master
* Run the command: python main.py
* To run a custom theme, add the theme name after main.py.  For example run: python main.py high-res for a high res version of the board.

##THEMES:
To create a new theme:
 - Create a new directory under `./images/themes` with the name of your theme. Eg: `./images/themes/MyTheme`
 - Each theme directory should contain the following:
 	- 40 images titled `space0.jpg` to `space39.jpg`. Each image corresponds to the 40 spaces on the board, starting at "Go" (space0) and going clockwise around the board, ending at "Boardwalk" (space39).
 	- A `spaces.csv` file with six rows
 - Each row in `spaces.csv` should be as follows:
	 1. The title of each of the 40 spaces, starting at Go, going clockwise. (40 cols)
	 2. The type of each space. There are different 10 spaces: (40 cols)
	 	- "property" - A purchasable property that can have houses on it
	 	- "railroad" - A purchasable railroad space, traditionally four on a board, in the middle of each row
	 	- "utility" - A purchasable utility space, traditionally two on a board.
	 	- "tax" - Income/Luxury Tax space. Non-purchasable. Traditionally two on a board
	 	- "chest" - Community Chest space. Non-purchasable. Draw a Community Chest card.
	 	- "chance" - Chance space. Non-purchasable. Draw a Chance card.
	 	- "go" - The initial space you start at. bottom-right corner
	 	- "jail" - In Jail/Just Visiting space. bottom-left corner of the board.
	 	- "parking" - The Free Parking space. top-left corner.
	 	- "gotojail" - Player goes to jail when on this space. top-right corner.
	 3. The price for each of the purchasable spaces. This includes properties, railroads, and utilities. (# of cols = # of properties + railroads + utilities on the board)
	 4. The rent for each of the purchasable spaces, not inluding utilities. (# of cols = # of properties + railroads)
	 5. The cost for each house. This is not the rent cost with houses, this is the price required to get one additional house. (# of cols = # of properties)
	 6. The color of each property. (# of cols = # of properties)

To run the program with your selected theme:  
`python main.py MyTheme`

If your theme does not work, the game will automatically revert to the default theme. If you remove, add, or modify anything in the `./images/themes/default/` directory, you may have to reinstall the game files.
